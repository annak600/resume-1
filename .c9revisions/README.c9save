The site itself is available at http://kristsauders.com/resume.\n\nThe resumé itself is actually stored as a JSON document (resume.json). When the main HTML resumé page (index.html) loads, \nthe JSON data is retrieved with JQuery and the HTML is rendered from it (main.js).\n\nThe styling and CSS come from Twitter Bootstrap.\n\nThe server is written in Node.JS (server.js) using Express. The API logic uses Restler, and e-mails are sent using Nodemailer.\n\nMost of the communications features use a Javascript plugin I recently wrote for the AT&amp;T API Platform (att.js). \nSince the AT&T API Platform currently does not fully support CORS yet, all att.js API calls are routed through a very\nsimple CORS enabled proxy at api.kristsauders.com. You can read more about the ATT-JS plugin at http://attjs.kristsauders.com.\n\nThe modal overlays use a JQuery plugin called Reveal."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":930}]],"length":930,"saved":false}
