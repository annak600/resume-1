This is Krists Auders' interactive, online resumé source code. The site itself is available at http://kristsauders.com/resume.

The resumé itself is actually stored as a JSON document (resume.json). When the main HTML resumé page (index.html) loads, 
the JSON data is retrieved with JQuery and the HTML is rendered from it (main.js).

The styling and CSS come from Twitter Bootstrap.

The server is written in Node.JS (server.js) using Express. The API logic uses Restler, and e-mails are sent using Nodemailer.

Most of the communications features use a Javascript plugin I recently wrote for the AT&amp;T API Platform (att.js). 
Since the AT&T API Platform currently does not fully support CORS yet, all att.js API calls are routed through a very
simple CORS enabled proxy at api.kristsauders.com. You can read more about the ATT-JS plugin at http://attjs.kristsauders.com.

The modal overlays use a JQuery plugin called Reveal.
